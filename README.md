# Python-SQL-Excel-Analysis
##📝 Project Overview
This project automates the process of loading data from CSV files into a MySQL database and performing basic data analysis and visualization. It demonstrates a streamlined workflow for managing and analyzing e-commerce data stored across multiple datasets.

##🚀 Features
Data Integration: Automates the creation of MySQL tables and inserts data directly from CSV files.
Data Cleaning: Handles NaN values and ensures compatibility between data formats and SQL data types.
Dynamic SQL Generation: Automatically generates CREATE TABLE and INSERT queries based on the structure of pandas DataFrames.
Analysis and Visualization: Includes basic queries and visualizations to explore the imported data.

##📁 Project Structure
CSV Files: Input data files containing e-commerce information (e.g., customers.csv, orders.csv, etc.).
Python Notebook: The Jupyter Notebook (Python-SQL-Excel project.ipynb) contains code for:
Reading and processing CSV files.
Establishing a connection to a MySQL database.
Loading data into MySQL tables.
Performing basic SQL queries and data analysis.
MySQL Database: A database named ecommerce stores the imported data.
