# Python-SQL-Excel-Analysis
## üìù Project Overview
This project automates the process of loading data from CSV files into a MySQL database and performing basic data analysis and visualization. It demonstrates a streamlined workflow for managing and analyzing e-commerce data stored across multiple datasets.

## üöÄ Features
‚Ä¢ Data Integration: Automates the creation of MySQL tables and inserts data directly from CSV files.

‚Ä¢ Data Cleaning: Handles NaN values and ensures compatibility between data formats and SQL data types.

‚Ä¢ Dynamic SQL Generation: Automatically generates CREATE TABLE and INSERT queries based on the structure of pandas DataFrames.

‚Ä¢ Analysis and Visualization: Includes basic queries and visualizations to explore the imported data.

## üìÅ Project Structure
‚Ä¢ CSV Files: Input data files containing e-commerce information (e.g., customers.csv, orders.csv, etc.).

‚Ä¢ Python Notebook: The Jupyter Notebook (Python-SQL-Excel project.ipynb) contains code for:

 ‚Ä¢ Reading and processing CSV files.

 ‚Ä¢ Establishing a connection to a MySQL database.

 ‚Ä¢ Loading data into MySQL tables.

 ‚Ä¢ Performing basic SQL queries and data analysis.

‚Ä¢ MySQL Database: A database named **ecommerce** stores the imported data.
